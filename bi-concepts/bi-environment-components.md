# BI environment components

* **Data dispersion**: Data tends to be dispersed and exist in _**different types of containers**_
* **Data containers**: _**Data stores**_ whose content may be _**of a different nature**_, due to the tool that generates said data.
* _**Contents**_: _**Text files, databases, etc**_. They are _**limited by**_ the corresponding access to the _**connectors available to the extraction tools**_. Apply to:
  * _**Data sources**_: Elements that store data in origin.
  * _**Data targets**_: Target data stores.
  * _**Data intermediate**_: Intermediate stores, which may be necessary to use for a specific treatment of the data at a given time, for the modeling of these.
