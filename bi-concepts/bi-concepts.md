# BI concepts



[**Gartner - source Wikipedia -**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner): North American consulting company dedicated to researching the IT industry, analyzing market trends and preparing the ranking of technological solutions, which they publish in the form of what they call "magic quadrants". Its magic quadrants for BI solutions are a benchmark in the market

**Magic quadrants**

* Rankings are based on Gartner's _**proprietary methodology**_
* They allow the _**sharing of trends in usability, design, learning curve, etc.**_, of the different tools on the market
* The _**rankings**_ are published in what are called _**“Magic Quadrants”**_
* They are an _**elegant and simple way to present**_ the way in which the different _**market players**_ are _**positioned**_
* They are _**very well structured and easy to understand**_. With a simple glance you can locate the tool and its position compared to competitors
* They are _**very schematic**_, so that the understanding of the results is available to anyone
* **X Axis**: Defines the “completeness of vision” (completeness of _**vision**_) and represents _**market knowledge**_
* **Y-axis**: Defines the "ability to execute” and aims to measure the _**ability to successfully execute**_ your vision (knowledge) of the market
* **Quadrants**: Both axes divide the graph into four quadrants or sectors (_**leaders, visionaries, challengers and niche players**_)

**Quadrant description**

* **Leaders quadrant**
  * It is the best, standing here _**means having scored high on both measurement axes**_ (X=vision or knowledge of the market, Y=ability to execute the vision)
  * _**Provide a complete and mature product solution**_, which _**evolves according to market demand**_
  * Suggests that the _**supplier is in good health as a business and has sufficient means to successfully implement its solution in various scenarios**_
  * In the 2022 Gartner Report, they are in this quadrant:
    * _**Power BI**_ (the best positioned)
    * Tableau
    * Qlik (the worst positioned)

>

* **Visionaries quadrant**
  * They have a _**good score in “completeness of vision”**_ but _**a worse score in “ability to execute”**_
  * They have a _**strong**_ (and accurate) _**vision (knowledge)**_ of the current market
  * _**They may not yet have the capacity to perform deployments**_
  * They are _**capable of predicting the trend in terms of usability and software resources, but at the level of implementation management, they do not have a potential**_

>

* **Challenger quadrant (challengers or applicants)**
  * It is the _**opposite case of the visionaries**_
  * Well positioned and that _**offer high chances of success when implementing your solution**_
  * They usually offer _**little variety of products, or directly focus on a single aspect of what the market demands**_
  * _**They can be companies specialized in a certain product, or sector**_
  * Also _**may be a shortfall in your sales channel or geographic presence**_

>

* **Quadrant of niche players (niche players)**
  * It is _**the most unfavorable**_
  * They don't score high enough in any category to reach one of the other quadrants, but _**doesn't mean**_ that's why _**their solutions don't have quality**_
  * _**Appearing in Gartner's magic box**_ means that said _**company or tool is highly recognized in its segment**_, but it may not comply, or it may not stand out due to its global ratings that would position it in another quadrant, but it does have qualities to be recognized by this prestigious consulting firm

**Most used dashboards (according to Gartner)**

* Microsoft _**Power BI**_ (Desktop and Service). It is the best positioned tool
* _**Tableau**_ (Tableau Desktop, Tableau Prep, Tableau Online)
* _**Qlik**_ (View, Sense and Cloud)

>

**ETL tools**

* _**Open sources**_
  * _**Kettle**_ (now _**Pentaho**_ Data Integration). This tool is developed in Java and is very scalable
  * _**Scriptella**_ Open Source ETL Tool
  * _**Talend**_ Open Studio
  * _**Jitterbit**_
  * etc.

>

* _**Proprietary software (for a fee)**_
  * IBM _**Cognos**_ Decisionstream
  * _**Data Integrator**_ (Sap Business Objects tool)
  * _**Ascential**_ Datastage (now IBM _**Websphere**_ DataStage)
  * _**Microsoft Integration Services**_. This tool is, in the market, closely related to SQL Server and Power BI
  * _**Oracle Warehouse Builder**_
  * _**Pervasive**_
  * _**Informatica PowerCenter**_
  * etc.

>

* The _**number**_ of _**proprietary software tools**_ is _**greater**_ than the available _**open source software resources**_
* Depending on the needs of the project _**it may be more convenient to use open source tools than proprietary software**_
* _**Choosing one type of ETL or another**_ is something that _**should be assessed depending on the context**_ in which the project is going to be developed
* The _**open source**_ tools often imply a _**customization cost**_ of the same, which usually generates the need to modify the code and these frequently imply the hiring of external services . In other words, _**open source tools may contain hidden costs**_
* _**An error in decision can generate**_ a burden that in the long run increases the cost of the project, or even _**the failure**_ of this
* Proprietary software does not only consist of the acquisition of licenses, but there may be other elements to take into account, which can make the cost of implementing the project higher in the case of the use of open source tools (a priori)

**Points to consider**

* _**The existence or not of a market for specialized professionals**_ in the tool
* _**The existence or not of available resources**_ to improve the tool
* _**The existence or not of necessary technological support**_
* _**The existence or not of a community of users and specialists**_ in the tool
