# Position Power BI against competitors

**Microsoft Power BI**

* BI solution from _**Microsoft**_
* Allows you to _**connect**_ to _**over 65 different data sources**_
* Allows (on the data):
  * _**Modelling**_
  * _**Analysis**_
  * _**Presentation**_ (dashboards, _**applications and reports**_)
* The _**connectors**_ to the data sources:
  * They are _**grouped according to the type of origin**_
    * Databases
    * External sources
    * Files
    * Open Data
    * etc.
* Fully _**integrated into the Microsoft ecosystem**_. It allows very simple access to items stored in SharePoint or OneDrive, as well as other tools from the same ecosystem
* With the report panels (or _**dashboards**_) it is achieved that _**information can be consulted by users in a very easy, attractive and intuitive way**_. Currently it is more advisable to use apps
* The _**dashboards**_ allow _**agility in interpreting the information and interacting with it, through the different graphs and tables represented**_
* The _**exploitation of data**_, through panels and reports, also allows it to be shared by many users of the same organization
* Is the _**leader in the “Leaders”**_ quadrant of Gartner's magic square
* Has been able to _**understand the needs of the BI market**_ and _**make the tool evolve**_ in a short period of time, compared to other competitors
* Has been able to understand the need of the BI market, _**combined with the experience in the Office environment**_, to generate a resource that comes from a complex and segmented context, for people with experience
* The _**first version**_ (not yet called Power BI) _**is from 2011**_ and was offered in the SQL Server package and in Excel 2010 _**under the name of Power Pivot**_, accompanied by other add-ins that were part of that version of Excel, such as Power Query, Power View, and Power Map
* The _**first version**_ based on the same core as Power Pivot (_**independent of Microsoft Excel**_), was released in _**December 2014**_. It was presented in _**desktop version with the name “Power BI Designer”**_
* Some of the reasons why Microsoft Power BI is a leader in this type of platform:
  * It is a _**visual tool that is very close to the user**_
  * Practically all the most common and used actions can be done with a mouse click. _**Made primarily for the end user**_
  * It is a _**very intuitive work environment**_, extrapolating ease of learning and usability, to any tool in the context of Microsoft Office
  * It is _**fully compatible with Excel**_:
    * Has _**dynamic connections**_
    * The _**graphics are very similar**_
    * It is _**structured**_ in the same way with _**values for some fields and dimensions for others**_
    * _**Power Pivot developments**_ can be imported natively
    * _**Makes it easy to switch from Excel to this tool**_
    * _**Can connect to Excel data models and create pivot tables and charts**_. Even import such tables and models directly
* _**Updates appear every month**_
  * _**Improvements are added or the resources of the tool are optimized**_
  * _**Optimize views**_, to make resource use and data modeling easier
* Currently the most notable _**limitation**_ is the need to _**have at least Windows 8**_ installed on the computer with the Power BI installation
* _**Microsoft**_, through Power BI, _**listens to the community**_:
  * _**Any contribution proposed by users of the community is studied and published in subsequent versions**_, so it is in constant progress and always makes things very easy for the user
* _**Registration is free**_
  * _**Power BI Desktop can be installed on a computer and learned to use it, without the need to purchase a license**_. The user can make decisions regarding their BI needs, once they know the tool itself
* _**Connectors to data sources of different nature easy and fast**_
  * Facilitates connection to _**multiple origins both locally and remotely, without the need for advanced knowledge in the implementation of origins**_
* _**Synchronization with data sources**_
  * Allows _**synchronization**_ with source data sources, so _**dashboards are always up-to-date**_
  * _**Depending on the update frequency**_ of these data sources, it can be _**synchronized with different periodicities**_, that is, dashboards that require data with a monthly frequency, can be updated 1 time a month
* _**Easy review**_ of dashboards _**in real time**_
  * Once the dashboard is developed, _**it is very easy to make adjustments and changes, as well as publish them to production**_
  * Being able to make these changes in real time is an added value that _**facilitates pre-publication and even post-publication adjustments to dashboards**_
* Representation of KPIs with _**interactive visualization of graphs**_
  * The _**graphics**_ shown on the sheets, _**can interact between the elements that make up the dashboard**_ with the rest of the KPIs represented, so that it is easy to segment
* _**Fully customizable**_ for the needs of the organization and work team
  * _**A corporate work environment can be created**_, based on the company's own image and segmented for a work team, _**as long as the purchased license allows it**_
* _**Security**_ in displaying information
  * _**View permissions**_ of the dashboards can be assigned, allowing access only to members of the organization that require such access
  * \*\*\* Information can be segmented, so that users who access only see the information relevant to them \*\*\*, in a very intuitive way
* _**Large repository of visuals**_
  * _**In addition to the visual objects**_ that are available _**by default**_ in the tool itself, _**there is a repository of other objects (AppSource)**_ that can be used very easily
  * The only common _**requirement**_ for this type of object is the need to _**have a Microsoft Power BI account**_
* _**Mobile app available for Windows, IOS and Android**_
  * Ability to _**make decisions**_ based on data _**from anywhere in the world**_
  * Possibility to _**adapt the design**_ of the dashboards for an _**optimized display on mobile devices**_
* Very _**intuitive**_ and friendly
  * The learning curve allows _**start developing from the first contact**_
* _**Extensive documentary and assistance repository**_
  * It has a _**wide repository with documentation**_, for better understanding and knowledge
  * In many of the points of the repository, _**examples**_ are presented that facilitate adaptation to the environment
* _**Large support community**_
  * There is a _**large number of forums, pages and other online resources**_, which facilitate _**support and the resolution of problems and doubts**_ that may arise along the way of learning
